# Tapcode Cipher
Tapcode Cipher is a simple command-line application written in Rust that implements the Tapcode or Prison cipher, which is a system of encoding and decoding messages using a 5x5 grid of letters. Each letter is represented by a series of "taps," where the number of taps corresponds to the position of the letter in the grid. 

## Features:
- **Encode a message**: Converts a message into Tapcode using the current grid.
- **Decode Tapcode**: Converts Tapcode back into a message using the current grid.
- **Custom Grid**: Users can create and customize their own 5x5 grid for encoding/decoding.
- **Save Grid**: Save the current grid to a file for future use.
- **Load Grid**: Load a saved grid from a file.
